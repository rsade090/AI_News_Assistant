    "text": "After a week spent seeking a lifeline, an Ontario court has given Canada's oldest company permission to start liquidating all but six of its stores on Monday.The Friday approval from Ontario Superior Court Judge Peter Osborne allows the retailer to begin selling off inventory at most of its 80 Hudson's Bay stores, three Saks Fifth Avenue locations and 13 Saks Off 5th shops in Canada.\"This is the art of the possible, and we are where we are today. In my view, there is no other alternative,\"\u00a0Osborne said Friday.The six stores being saved from the liquidation sale\u00a0include a flagship location on Yonge Street in Toronto, as well as a store in the city's Yorkdale Mall and another farther north in Hillcrest Mall in Richmond Hill, Ont. The remaining three are in Montreal, the Carrefour Laval mall and Pointe-Claire, Que.The company didn't\u00a0say how deep discounts will be during the liquidation, running\u00a0until June 15. It will vacate all liquidating stores by June 30.But the move to save six locations could save some of the 9,364 jobs that would have been lost\u00a0had the company needed to liquidate all of its stores, which was the plan until recent\u00a0sales\u00a0exceeded expectations.Six stores are now able to be saved\u00a0because the looming liquidation triggered a flurry of sales from customers looking to snap up Hudson's Bay's famed striped products and other home goods and apparel.(Alex Lupul/CBC)\"If a solution can be found, there is an opportunity to pull additional stores out of the liquidation.\u00a0But if a restructuring solution is not found very quickly, [the six]\u00a0will be added to the liquidation sale,\" Hudson's Bay lawyer Ashley Taylor said in court\u00a0on Friday.The ruling marks a glimmer of hope for the company, which filed for creditor protection on March 7. The request showed the company was facing significant financial challenges and was desperately in need of cash to keep making even basic payments that sustain the business.While the retailer suffered from reduced consumer spending, trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada and a post-pandemic slide in downtown store traffic, Hudson's Bay deferred payments to landlords and suppliers and eventually had to resort to seeking financing, which pushed it toward liquidation.The possibility of the 355-year-old company disappearing triggered a flurry of sales in recent days from customers looking to snap up apparel, home goods and Hudson's Bay's famed point blankets which date back to 1779, when the fur trade was in full swing.Earlier this week, its Toronto flagship location on Queen Street West was close to selling out of items bearing the brand's iconic green, red, yellow and indigo stripes. Sales were so strong between March 8 and 14 that the company made $21 million, beating its own estimates by about $7.4 million, court documents show.WATCH | Who's to blame for\u00a0the Bay's troubles?:Who killed Hudson's Bay?3 days agoDuration5:28After more than 350 years in business, Canada's oldest company is teetering on the brink of collapse \u2014 but who\u2019s to blame? CBC\u2019s Eli Glasner puts three key suspects under the department store interrogation light.The cash from the sales will allow the company to pay a joint venture with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, through which it owns some real estate, up to $7 million monthly in rent. It can now also pay back $16 million in financing it received from Restore Capital earlier in the month to keep it afloat.Taylor said Friday the company will continue to \"work hard\" to find a \"more long-term solution\"\u00a0for its financial woes, but warned\u00a0the window to achieve this \"remains very short.\"WATCH | After9\u00a0clothes\u00a0pulled\u00a0from Bay locations:Activewear owner pulls inventory from Hudson\u2019s Bay as stores liquidate2 days agoDuration7:41Olivia Glauberzon, owner of the After9 maternity activewear brand, says the situation is \u2018unfortunate,\u2019 but she has opted to pull its inventory from Hudson's Bay locations in Toronto, adding that retail is a \u2018people business\u2019 and that wasn\u2019t prioritized in stores. Hudson\u2019s Bay is liquidating all but six of its stores; its flagship location on Yonge Street in Toronto is one of the stores that will be spared.While the company carries out the work, it will start a sales process for assets such as its leases\u00a0and Canadians will see deals at stores set to be gutted.Whether they shop in person or online, they will find Hudson's Bay has paused its loyalty program, which has 8.2 million Canadian members with about $58.5 million in unused points.\u00a0It will stop accepting the $24.2 million outstanding gift cards consumers have after April 6.All sales will be final at the liquidating stores, Hudson's Bay says.Road to judgmentTo arrive at a judgment, Osborne had to reconcile how the company could liquidate its inventory, pursue more financing and also seek a buyer for valuable assets, like its leases or even the intellectual property associated with its name or striped products.\"I want to make sure we haven't sold the jewels in the crown \u2026 so to make a better outcome impossible,\" he said in court earlier this week, hours before he reserved his judgment for the day and urged the lawyers he had heard from to \"lower the temperature.\"The move could save some of the 9,364 jobs that would have been lost\u00a0had the company moved to liquidate all of its stores, which was the plan until recent\u00a0sales\u00a0exceeded expectations, allowing it to keep six locations alive.(Alex Lupul/CBC)The dozens of lawyers at proceedings over the course of the week represented everyone from unpaid elevator companies to landlords.The property owners worried a liquidation wouldn't just leave their malls and properties with enormous spaces to fill, but would also hamper foot traffic to other tenants whose wares would become less attractive\u00a0when compared to the Bay's reduced prices.Lawyer Taylor used his appearances to promise Hudson's Bay\u00a0would \"cast the net as wide as possible\" to find backers who could salvage or rebuild the business.He said earlier this week that it had approached 19 lenders, but so far, \"the company's efforts have failed,\" necessitating liquidation.Staff stare down possible job lossesDespite six\u00a0stores being saved from the liquidation sale, for more than 9,000 employees on the company's payroll, the closure of stores\u00a0will have deep consequences.\"I will be 62 in May and my plan was to work till 65 and retire, but it looks like that's not going to happen,\" said Kevin Grell who works as an e-commerce processor at the Scarborough online distribution site.\"It is sad. Especially at my age, it is difficult to get a job,\" he said. \"Everybody's worried, everybody's sad, some of them are angry, which is understandable. They just can't believe it happened.\"WATCH | What happens to all that commercial real estate:What could happen to prime real estate occupied by Hudson's Bay stores5 days agoDuration10:44Canada's oldest retailer, Hudson's Bay, is in court this week staring down the prospect of liquidating its business that has historical roots dating back to 1670. Tony Letvinchuk, managing director of Macdonald Commercial Real Estate, says it's likely that multi-floor retail or even mixed-use buildings take the place of the large department store buildings.As the situation currently stands, staff could see their jobs disappear in a matter of days or weeks, depending on how fast the company moves. Many have no idea whether they will hang onto their pensions and benefits, or even receive severance.Grell, who is a union steward,\u00a0said they had a meeting with the union last week and asked about severance.\"They came out and honestly told us that in situations like this, don't expect the severance, because it's at the bottom of the barrel \u2026 so it's very unlikely we'll get anything.\"Andrew Hatnay, a lawyer representing employees, repeatedly told the court he felt the entire process was moving too quickly because the company moved from creditor protection to a full sell-off in roughly a week.He said he didn't see the saving of the six stores as reason for celebration.\"We will see how this works out but even \u2026\u00a0if they pull something out of their hat, stores are still going down,\" he told court. \"That is not a good news story.\"Hudson's Bay's demise marks the death of the traditional department store in CanadaHudson's Bay is in limbo after filing for creditor protection. Here's what you need to knowWinnipeg shoppers 'heartbroken' as future uncertain for Hudson's Bay Co.At stake, he said,\u00a0were not just thousands of jobs, but benefits, pensions and severance. There are 21,000 past and present employees spanning Hudson's Bay, Saks Fifth Avenue and earlier acquisitions Simpsons, Kmart Canada and Zellers in the pension plan, which court documents say is currently fully funded.Employees say they are not expecting severance, which Hatnay estimates could have amounted to a collective $100 million.\"This is melancholy,\" he told the judge. \"This is the demise of HBC, slowly but surely.\""

    "text": "Many Tesla owners who were once proud to own the electric vehicle\u00a0are reportedly nowembarrassed to be associated with the brand, as public furor against the company and its CEO, billionaire Elon Musk, gains momentum.Musk'sinfluence in the White Househas been tied to anger directed at Tesla\u00a0\u2014 includingMolotov cocktails thrown at a showroomin Las Vegas, dozens ofTesla cars vandalizedin Hamilton andprotestsacross\u00a0North America and Europe. Even the Vancouver International Auto Show, which began on Wednesday and runs until Sunday,removed the automaker from this year's\u00a0event, citing safety concerns for attendees and exhibitors.Now some Tesla owners who aren't fans of the company's owner are eitherscooping up anti-Musk bumper stickersorboycotting the brandby getting rid of their vehicles altogether.Unhappy with U.S. President Donald Trump's treatment of Canada, John Suk,\u00a0of St. Catharines, Ont., decided to sell his Tesla and buy\u00a0a Hyundai \u2014 even though he says he\u00a0admired\u00a0Musk's innovations in the auto industry and his work in the field of space, and was impressed by Tesla's\u00a0charging network.This Sunday,Cross Country\u00a0Checkupis asking:Whether you own a Tesla or not, what's your reaction to all the backlash?Leave your commenthereand\u00a0we\u00a0may read it or\u00a0call\u00a0you back for our show.\"I always loved the car. I had it for five years.\u00a0But with Elon Musk behaving the way he is,\u00a0\u2026\u00a0I can't support the ownership of that company,\" he said, adding that he believes Musk is destroying the brand.Suk\u00a0said he is boycotting everything American\u00a0and will not travel to the U.S. right now. \"I stopped doing that last year and I won't go there till Trump's long gone.\"Demonstrators hold signs during a protest outside Tesla's showroom in Seattle on Feb. 15. 'Tesla Takedown' protests have been held throughout Canada, the U.S. and parts of Europe.(David Ryder/Reuters)The anti-Tesla sentiment in Canada has only been gaining traction as people\u00a0in several cities, including Ottawa and Vancouver, joined a wave of\"Tesla Takedown\"protests to voice displeasure with\u00a0Musk's role in sweepingcuts to the U.S. federal workforceandcancelling contracts related to humanitarian programs.\"You can't divorce the personality from the business enterprise,\u00a0and so, generally speaking, CEOs tend to keep a lower profile,\" said Marvin Ryder, an associate professor of marketing at McMaster University's DeGroote School of Business in Hamilton.Here's why Elon Musk has lost billions (and is still the richest person in the world)\"Mr. Musk in his world, much like Mr. Trump in his world, have decided that they want the personality to outshine the brand,\" he said. \"So if I was on the board of Tesla, if I am one of the owners of Tesla stock, I am not happy.\"Ryder added that he believes Musk should take a leave of absence from the company\u00a0while pursuing his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE),\u00a0announced by Trump even before he took office on Jan. 20, with a promise to slash jobs and spending.\"Leave your CEO's position and divorce yourself from the company while you go and do that,\" he\u00a0said.Tesla did not immediately respond to CBC News's request for comment.WATCH | Montreal dealership vandalized:Tesla dealership vandalized as backlash grows against Elon Musk4 days agoDuration2:04A Montreal Tesla dealership was vandalized, and the Vancouver International Auto Show has removed the vehicles for its events over safety concerns as backlash grows against Elon Musk and his influence in the White House.'No longer a source of pride'Don Flatt says he also is not a fan of Musk, but he really wanted to enter the electric car market. He found a used 2024 Tesla Model 3 and convinced himself that because it was used, he wasn't actually giving any money to Musk.\"I bought my Tesla before Elon Musk became a crazy person,\" he said, adding that he loves the car for its efficiency and fast charging.\"Still not a fan of Elon. He definitely bought a winning company, though \u2014 well, at least it was,\" said Flatt.The Fredericton resident,\u00a0who recently retired as an editor at the CBC,\u00a0said he\u00a0thought a magnet might be better than a bumper sticker, because when the current tension\u00a0eventually goes away, he could remove it. But then he came up with the idea of making anagrams out of the Tesla logo.Flatt is now planning\u00a0to take\u00a0off the logo at the back of the car and create an anagram\u00a0that spells either \"Steal\"\u00a0or \"Least.\"A Tesla dealership is shown in Surrey, B.C., on Wednesday. Musk has lost several billion dollars of his personal wealth this year as shares in Tesla and sales of its electric vehicles plunge. The company that made Musk his fortune is no longer the most valuable asset in his portfolio.(Ben Nelms/CBC)Others who enjoy driving the car have been trying to dissociate the brand from the owner, while still holding on to a Tesla.\"Five years ago, I considered Elon Musk an idol and admired his business ventures with Tesla\u00a0and\u00a0SpaceX in particular,\" said Paul Turnbull, of Ottawa.\"I was a proud purchaser of a Tesla Model Y soon after they became available for order in Canada in 2021.

It appears to have hurt Tesla's sales on the continent, which weredown 45 per cent\u00a0in Januaryfrom a year earlier.Motorists have also traded in a record number of Tesla vehicles this month,data from national car shopping website Edmundsshowed.\u00a0March's trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues.Vancouver International Auto Show removes Tesla over safety concernsDavid Tindall, a sociology professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, said he suspects the backlash against the electric automaker is just the beginning of a larger movement against Trump.\"Tesla is kind of the low-hanging fruit in a mass protest that is going to ramp up against this whole administration,\" he said.Whether there is any coming back from the controversy\u00a0for Musk and the company, Tindall said, \"those are the two scenarios \u2014 that sales pick up amongst Trump supporters or that he sells Tesla.\""

    "text": "Last week, late at night, when Rob Frith was wrapping up a work session\u00a0at a friend's studio, he decided to throw on one last tape for a listen.It was labelled \"Beatles 60s demos\" and had been sitting around Neptoon Records, one of Vancouver's most well-known record shops, unplayed. Frith, who owns the shop, had never listened to it, but had brought the recording to his friend's studio that night, knowing he had the right player for the tape.\"I thought it was just a reel-to-reel tape that somebody had put bootleg things on,\" Frith said.But when the tape played, the quality of the sound was clear and bright.\"It seemed like the Beatles were in the room,\" he said.WATCH | Valuable Beatles recording discovered at Vancouver record shop:Rare early recording of The Beatles unearthed in Vancouver record store2 days agoDuration2:50A rare recording of an early Beatles demo session has surfaced in a Vancouver record store. As CBC's Rafferty Baker reports, the tape appears to have made its way to Vancouver about 50 years ago. But exactly how it ended up in the record shop isn't clear.Frith took a short video of the tape as it played\u00a0and posted that clip on social media. Beatles fans were in awe, and messages started pouring in, Frith said.Based on his conversations and some research, Frith believes the tape is a rare, direct copy of a famous audition recording from the band's early days.Decca auditionIn the early 1960s, before the Beatles signed with Parlophone records and releasedPlease Please Me, the band went searching for a label to sign with.Part of that search included recording an audition tape with Decca Studios in London, on Jan.\u00a01, 1962.The owner of Neptoon Records, one of Vancouver\u2019s most well-known independent record shops, regularly acquires items from other peoples' music collections.(Rafferty Baker/CBC)Decca ultimately passed on signing the fledgling group, but the audition tape survived, and was eventually made available as a bootleg album starting in the late 70s.Finding one of those would be fairly unremarkable, but whenFrithand his friend\u00a0LarryHennesseyplayed the tape that night they knew they had something special.Hennessey, who is experienced in music preservation, said he got a hint that the recording may be rare as soon as they took it out of the box and he saw white tape, known as leader tape, physically separating each song.\"The way that's wound on the tape, you can see that it separates the tracks \u2026 it's not a fast copy or a bootleg,\" he said.Frith, who acquires new tapes from collections on a regular basis, said he isn't certain who he got the tape from.Larry Hennessey says the white tape separating each song on this recording is called leader tape. Its presence, he says, indicates that it's not a bootleg tape.(Rafferty Baker/CBC )Left behindAfter Frith's\u00a0post online with the clip made the rounds on social media,\u00a0someone from the local recording scene reached out and connected Frith with a man who knew all about the tape's origin: Jack\u00a0Herschorn.Herschorn, a former owner of Mushroom Records in Vancouver, brought the tape across the Atlantic in the early 70s.During a work trip to London, a producer Herschorn\u00a0knew handed him the tape and suggested he could put out copies of it in North America.\"I took it back and I thought about it quite a bit \u2026 I didn't want to put it out because I felt \u2014\u00a0I didn't think it was a totally moral thing to do,\" he said.\"These guys, they're famous and they deserve to have the right royalties on it \u2026 it deserves to come out properly,\" Herschorn said, adding that he didn't personally know the Beatles at that time.Jack Herschorn, a Canadian record company executive, bought Mushroom Studios in 1971. He eventually left the business, and now lives in Mexico.(Rafferty Baker/CBC)He remembers listening to the tape, enjoying it, and wishing the world-famous musicians had been signed with his label instead.Herschorn held onto the tape, but only for a while. When he eventually left the business, he\u00a0forgot the tape.\"I should have took it, but it didn't work out that way. You know, I had other things going on. I\u00a0wasn't thinking about it.\"Treasure preservedThinking ahead to the future of the tape, Herschorn said his hope is that Frith approaches Paul\u00a0McCartney and suggests they release the tape.Larry Hennessey has a music studio in Vancouver that has the equipment to play a wide variety of old tapes. Recently, his friend Rob Frith brought an old Beatles tape to play at the studio, only for them to discover it was a rare recording.(Rafferty Baker/CBC)But Frith said he's not sure what's next. As a collector himself, he's not eager to sell it.He's also not about to release the recordings to the public on his own, but if Decca wanted a clean version of it, he'd give the label a copy, he said. Or if McCartney were to come to Neptoon Records in person,\u00a0Frith\u00a0said he would give it to him.Since there were bootlegs of the recording already out there, big Beatles fans have already heard the tracks, though not with this clarity, Frith said.\"People say it could be really valuable. I don't know. I'm glad it's preserved,\" he said.Another option, Frith said, would be to host an event in Vancouver where people could come and listen to it, and then donate the proceeds to charity."

In its court filing, AHS said Mentzelopoulos had displayed an \"alarming lack of strategic vision\" and had lost the confidence of AHS.Mentzelopoulos said the AHS board of directors had confidence in her throughout her work at AHS and \"did not lose confidence in her at any time.\"She added that the board never expressed any concerns to her about her performance, or \"about her work in guiding AHS through the (often underfunded and poorly articulated) health care 'refocusing' that was being directed by Alberta Health.\"Health Minister Adriana LaGrange, left, filed a statement of defence last week.(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)She went on to reference a Dec. 2, 2024, meeting with LaGrange to discuss the ongoing changes at AHS.Mentzelopoulos alleges that at this meeting, LaGrange told her that she was happy with the work she had been doing and allegedly said, \"I think you've done some phenomenal things in Alberta Health Services, like honestly I really do.\"Just over one month later, on Jan. 7, 2025, LaGrange was demanding the board fire Mentzelopoulos, she alleges.'Infatuated' with investigationLaGrange's statement of defence alleged that Mentzelopoulos became \"infatuated\" with her internal investigations. In rejecting that claim, Mentzelopoulos alleges that the AHS board recommended the investigation and external audit be expanded after being advised of their goals.\"Presumably the AHS board members were also 'infatuated' with the investigations as LaGrange bizarrely alleges against Mentzelopoulos in her statement of defence,\" the document reads.Mentzelopoulos also alleges that three deputy ministers attended a Dec. 19, 2024, AHS board meeting, in their dual capacities as deputy ministers and also as AHS board members. At that meeting, they \"heard the recommendation by other AHS board members that the investigation potentially be expanded and the matter be forwarded to the RCMP for potential criminal investigation.\"On Dec. 20, 2024, AHS sent a letter to MHCare Medical, Mentzelopoulos alleges. In 2022, MHCare secured a $70-million contract for children's pain medication from Turkey amid a nationwide drug shortage.The letter demanded \"a 'full accounting and reconciliation of the prepayments AHS made to MHCare' for the $70 million that was somehow prepaid by AHS to MHCare for the still unfilled provision of children's acetaminophen.\" A lawyer for MHCare did not immediately respond for comment on Friday.The next business day, on Dec. 23, 2024, Mentzelopoulos alleges she received a letter from Chris Nickerson, the assistant deputy minister of health. It \"instructed Mentzelopoulos to wind up the internal investigation in CSFs and transfer all related files to Alberta Health,\" she claims.She alleges it specifically directed that \"AHS shall cease any due diligence underway with respect to the CSF procurements or any selected proponents unless and until further notified.\"Investigation claimsMentzelopoulos goes on to allege that she spoke to Evan Romanow, the deputy minister of mental health and addictions, on Jan. 2, 2025.\"Romanow said the minister of mental health and addictions, Dan Williams, was 'very concerned' about the AHS internal investigations and the forensic audit,\" the document claims.Romanow said that Williams was \"concerned that the investigation could lead to potential connections between various government officials and Sam Mraiche and MHCare Medical around AHS procurement issues.\"In a statement released Saturday, Romanow responded to Mentzelopoulos's allegations of what transpired during their Jan. 2 conversation.Romanow said the purpose of the call was to \"confirm the status of the AHS investigation\" and he was surprised by the \"rumours and concerns of potential wrongdoing\" that Mentzelopoulos raised with him.\"It appears Ms. Mentzelopoulos has taken portions of that conversation entirely out of context, as though I was in agreement with or confirming portions of these concerns and allegations,\" Romanow's statement says.\"This is entirely inappropriate, untrue, and I find her willingness to distort my conversation with her to be hurtful and disheartening given our histories as trusted colleagues.\"Athana Mentzelopoulos, pictured in a file photo, filed a 'reply to statements of defence' with the court on Thursday.(CBC)At a press conference Friday morning, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said the government would be issuing a public statement responding to\u00a0Mentzelopoulos's allegations concerning Williams later in the day.Later in the March 20 document, Mentzelopoulos responded to an allegation from LaGrange's statement of defence that Mentzelopoulos was upset over plans to reduce the size of AHS, because it would \"reduce the size of the organization the plaintiff would preside over.\"\"Almost immediately, the plaintiff began expressing personal concern about being seen as a 'transitional' CEO if steps were taken to reform the management and structure of AHS as planned by the province,\" LaGrange's statement of defence reads.In her reply to that statement, Mentzelopoulos alleges she was \"specifically told in November 2023 by deputy minister of health [Andre] Tremblay and ADM [Darren] Hedley that the intention was for Mentzelopoulos to initially assume the role of president and CEO of AHS, and then be transitioned over to what became Acute Care Alberta.\"\"She was also assured and promised a four-year term of employment if she left her employment at the Alberta Medical Association,\" the document states."

We asked attendees at the Agriculture Expo in Lethbridge what topics matter the most to them.This is solid conservative territory \u2014 a region with a voting pattern that's so predictable, the political race here is normally a sleeper.But on this day, CBC News was not asking for voting intentions. We asked about hopes and priorities.An election campaign is a chance to debate a country's future, so we asked farmers about the issues that mattered to them this time around. What do they want the candidates to debate, and maybe even fix?Visitors check out some of the equipment on display at the Lethbridge Agricultural Exhibition in late February. It drew farmers from across southern Alberta.(Ose Irete/CBC)Van Uden is from Vauxhall, Alta., population 1,400. He works on a seed farm, but he hesitates when he thinks about settling down and having kids. Inflation, the cost of housing and groceries \u2014 these feel like a crisis, he said.That's what he wants politicians to focus on. He said everything else feels like a distraction.\"That's where I'd like to see a lot of change,\" he said. \"I respect anyone, all the LGBTQ. We all have our own life to live. You live it to your truth.\"But I'm tired of seeing the government constantly just easing to that side, constantly going on with it when I'd actually like to see them try and make this country livable and affordable for us to be a great country again.\"Cost of living ranks high across the countryDuring the federal election campaign, CBC News teams areasking these questions in different communitiesacross the country, and at the Ag-Expo, we spoke with more than 40 people in the market hall.If an election were held today, who would win? Check the CBC Poll TrackerLethbridge County sits in the centre of southern Alberta, about 75 kilometres from the American border. It's a land of rolling hills, cattle feedlots, irrigated fields and a mix of grains, potatoes, sugar beets and other specialty crops.Federally, this district voted for centre-right parties during every election since the 1930s.Drip irrigation systems are a common sight in the fields outside Lethbridge, Alta.(Elise Stolte/CBC)Many of the farmers, ranchers and agricultural business representatives here shared a strongly small-c conservative vision. They said southern Alberta is a land of exceptional opportunity for growing crops. But inflation, taxes and other costs have been making budgets tight, even before the U.S. tariffs. That creates a stress that drives some small farms under, and many want the candidates to set aside political distractions to focus on reducing costs, reducing taxes and growing markets for their products.That concern about cost echoes what's heard on the national stage.At the end of February, the polling company Leger asked 1,500 respondents for the No. 1\u00a0issue facing Canadians.It was tariffs, then inflationand respondents under 34 were the most likely to say\u00a0inflation.\u00a0For Nanos Research, respondents said the most important national issue of concern wasU.S. relations and then jobs.In an interview, Alberta-based pollster Janet Brown said in her polling, cost of living has been the dominant concern for two years. She believes tariffs are catching the public's attention in such a dramatic way because people are already so price-conscious and worried.On the busy market floor in Lethbridge, farmers went from booth to booth, checking new hay balers, solar panel technologies and soil testing techniques. Tariffs on steel could drive up the cost of heavy equipment and drive down prices for grain and specialty crops.CBC News was at the Ag-Expo just before the March 4\u00a0deadline when U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada.\u00a0Several people said they were keen to see Canada tackle interprovincial trade barriers, especially by improving the highway system.'Ticked off' by carbon taxBut even a tariff threat didn't erase other long-standing irritants. For many in this crowd, the carbon tax was still the horse to flog \u2014 even thoughboth ConservativeandLiberal leadershad, at that point, said they will replace or axe it. Liberal Leader Mark Carney passeda prime ministerial directiveto eliminate it at his first cabinet meeting.Many at the Ag-Expo see it as an unnecessary burden landing on top of everything else.Tony Bos was happy to illustrate that. He farms specialty crops near Coaldale, Alta., 15 kilometres northeast of Lethbridge. The farm fuel for his vehicles is\u00a0exempt from the carbon tax, but his suppliers and service crews face extra costs that filter down, and there's no exemption for the natural gas that heats his house and shop.Tony Bos with his home heating bill from January. He also pays to heat his shop on his farm near Coaldale, Alta.(Elise Stolte/CBC)His January\u00a0heating bill for the shop and house combined\u00a0was $2,987, of which the carbon tax was $1,101.\"Every time I look, I get ticked off,\" he said. \"I'm getting punished as a Canadian living in a cold country, heating my house. I just don't like that.\"The rebate for a couple living outside a major city in Alberta is $405 per quarter.Bos doesn't deny the climate is changing but wants Canada to be realistic about how much it can accomplish. He also blames the Liberal government for inflation because of the amount of spending during the pandemic. He thinks they went \"way overboard.\"\"They had money flowing out of all sides of their pockets to anybody,\" he said. \"It was totally uncalled for. I know they had to do something, but spending all that extra free money, you dilute the pot. You dilute the value of your dollar and you get inflation. It's very basic economics.\"\"I feel we have to go back to basics and just pay for what we can afford [in order to] focus on infrastructure. That's what our country needs, good infrastructure so we can move our stuff to the markets.\"Youth feeling anxious about the futureLethbridge County Reeve Tory Campbell calls this area\u00a0\"the most productive agricultural municipality in Alberta.\"He said producers here now generate more than $4 billion a year toward Canada's GDP. Growth has been driven by new opportunities in agricultural food processing, such as theCavendish Farms potato processing centre, and the technology improvements that let them use water more efficiently.Tory Campbell is reeve of Lethbridge County, one of the most productive agricultural counties in the country.(Elise Stolte/CBC)That means more opportunity, but the flip side is that capital costs and prices have increased. A hectare of non-irrigated land went from $600 per acre to $5,000 per acre in 20 years, accordingto Farm Credit Canada, and irrigated land is three times as much. That makes it hard for young people to get into the industry.That was the undercurrent of many conversations \u2014 young people want to see a place for themselves but feel anxious about the options and the cost.Zaine Helland, a 22-year-old new college graduate from Lomond, Alta., studied agriculture and said she's keen to help her family adopt new technologies to improve efficiency on the farm. But again, she said she wants candidates to focus on the cost of living \u2014 rent, groceries and fuel.She said: \"I'm kind of worried about my future, and if I'm ever going to be able to not live in debt and afford a house.\"From left to right, southern Alberta residents Hal Reed, Zaine Helland and Leslie Bostad.(Elise Stolte/CBC)Leslie Bostad can't vote yet. He's just 16 and, like Helland, he loves working on this family's seed farm. It's going well but with increased input costs, it feels fragile. Just the other day, a neighbour had a fire that took out a million-dollar combine and 40-acres worth of crops. That's hard to come back from.He said he wants candidates to focus on a plan to reduce costs and find tax breaks so he can keep doing this work forever.\"I couldn't live in the city; I know that,\" he said. \"Living, breathing the country, working, trying to figure things out. It's like, this broke, you're trying to jimmy-rig it with baler twine and two bolts; make it work. I love it all.\"Looking for growth and opportunitiesThe anxiety among the youth doesn't go unnoticed.Hal Reed is an agronomist with nine grandchildren. His family is doing fine, but he sees that malaise.\"I think we've got a generation that isn't quite as optimistic in the future,\" he said. \"We just need to get confidence back in our country, from our government.\"Talking with farmers, for many it seems to come down to reining in taxes and spending so businesses and policy makers can focus on the right infrastructure investments, with the ultimate goal of getting the economy to a place where it gives secure opportunities for generations.Georgina Knitel stood in the market hall across from a new baler at the end of the day. She's a business advisor who does succession planning with family farms, and summed up the hope people seem to be looking for amid high costs and tariffs.\"I really would like to see the candidates speak about our resource development and how we could leverage that to help drive our productivity,\" she said, pointing to countries like the Netherlands, which manageshigh agricultural outputs with limitednatural resources.\"I don't think borrowing our way or taxing our way is going to get us out of the predicament we're in. So if we could talk about how to develop [resources], and if we want to hold those entrepreneurs and those companies to the highest environmental and social standards, so be it.\""

Tim Perry, president of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) Canada.WestJet has already received federal approval to hire through the TFW program, the union said. Neither the airline nor Employment and Social Development Canada have confirmed those details to CBC News.Perry said the union has no problems with permanent immigration or with hiring newcomers, but objects to the airline's use of the TFW program in particular.If WestJet has a problem attracting enough pilots, he said, it should work on improving its collective agreement, rather than looking abroad for a source of temporary labour.The Sunday Magazine32:21The high stakes of changes to Canada's immigration policyWith a surge in population growth sparking affordability concerns, the federal government has been making a series of policy changes meant to restrict the volume of temporary residents entering and staying in Canada.

It stems from the COVID-19 pandemic when the whole industry was put on hold, he said.In his view, the TFW program is not the way for the airline to address its staffing issues.\"WestJet is trying to short-circuit the process of hiring Canadian pilots,\" said Gradek, who is a faculty lecturer in aviation management at McGill University.\"This is not the way we basically look at hiring high-quality, good-paying, very demanding pilot jobs in Canada.\"So far, WestJet says it has not yet hired any workers through the TFW program.From fast food to construction, employers turn more and more to temporary foreign workersAlberta seeking to recruit foreign workers from United Arab Emirates, emails sayPerry said he is also frustrated the union has not received any overtures from the federal government. If WestJet hopes to use the federal TFW program, which is intended for instances where no domestic workers are available, Perry said he thinks a government worker should invite the union to weigh in about whether this is the case.\"In our view, our collective bargaining rights have been absolutely undermined in this case by the government,\" said Perry.In response to questions from CBC News, a spokesperson for Employment and Social Development Canada said it couldn't speak to the situation for privacy reasons.The spokesperson pointed to an onlinedatabasewith information about employers that have received approval to hire temporary foreign workers, though it has not yet been updated with information about approvals in\u00a02025."
